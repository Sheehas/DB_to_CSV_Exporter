During the conversion process, the script will display progress information, indicating the number of files processed and the percentage of completion.

Once the conversion is complete, CSV files for each table will be generated in the same directory as the script.
Note

    Ensure that the script and the SQLite database files are located in the same directory.
    The script assumes that the tables in the database have no interdependencies (i.e., foreign keys) that could affect the order of data extraction.
